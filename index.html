        <p>Welcome to this navigation practice page! This is the home section where I will put text I feel belongs in the home section.</p><p>For now, I need to add some text here to make the section longer, and see if the navigation tags bring me to the sections I am aiming for.</p><p>So far this navigation page is working out pretty well, I have been able to add an email address, and phone number to the contact section. I will try it to see if it actually brings me to an email so I can send the email and be contacted by it.of it.<span class="highlight"> I just tried the link in "Contact" and it brought me directly to my Outlook email, so I tried mom's email address, and it brings me to outlook, then brings up a blank page, without anywhere to send an email. I will work with ths to see if I can get it working.</span></p>
        <!-- Wow! I just changed the font color for part of this pararaph: You have to use a <span class="highlight"> to do it-->

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Learn more about our company in this section.<br>I am fillig in some text here to make the page longer.<br>This is to see if when the page is longer, and I click on the navigation bar, it will scroll down the page to the section I am looking for.I love that I have discovered the br element and that I can actually do two consecutive paragraphs.</span></p>
            <p>I wonder if this will skip a line begin a whole new paragraph.<br>There is only one way to find out, and that is by trying, saving and looking at each thing I add.<span class="highlight"> (No it didn't. Using the "br" element only brings text down a line, but does NOT start a new paragraph with a space between paragraphs.)</span></p>
            <p>I'm thinking this will give me a whole new paragraph, seeing as the br and then skipping two lines didnt work.</p>
            <p>Yes, that's what I have to do to get another sectioin. </p>
            <p>If I keep at this, I will eventually get it.<br>I won't get any work done, and my house will be a total disaster, but I will have used my brain, persisted, and learned something new.<br>A small price to pay.

            <p>Right now this section is labeled contact, but I will probably change it to something else when I decide what else I might want to add here.</p>
            <p>For now, I will put contact information here that might allow me to try different things.<br><span class="highlight">For example, I just underlined text below using a span, which is something I haven't done before.</span>
